		I lived in Durban in South Africa. I really liked the good weather there and the hot climate. Poznań is so much colder but the people are at least nice. Also in Poland, almost nobody can speak English and in South Africa, most of the people could so I could communicate with them. When migrating to Poland I felt like I would be going for a new adventure and I felt excited to see how is it like. We already knew our classmates so we weren't stressed about the school. What we were really stressed about was the surrounding, weather and location.
