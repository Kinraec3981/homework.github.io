		I lived in Birmingham in the United States. It was full of interesting cities and places. The people weren't different just the languages spoken were different in both of the countries. My first impressions of Poland were that it was more old style and it didn't have as much modern technologies like in America. When we first heard from our parents that we are migrating to Poland, we were shocked because we have been to Poland before for vacations, but we never knew one day we would move here. When migrating to Poland it was awkward at first. I was scared of school because of making new friends and meeting new people. After getting some friends and getting to know the school better, it felt great.
